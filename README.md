# MaterialPWA

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.2.3.

## About this project

This was my freetime project to create a working Progressive Web App (PWA) based on Angular@PWA module. Inside the web app it contains the simplest form of HERE Maps API and OpenWeatherMap API. However, this project is not considered 'complete' nor 'stable', just a showcase of simple implementation of PWA that works on Chrome for Android.

Don't expect a carefully designed WUI, it's rough. :D

## What didn't work

The 'weather' didn't work offline on my phone. I suspect that it didn't cache the API data, else works. I have no idea how to solve this issue so far.

## Contribution

There is not much resources online about PWA out there (in this moment), so I think I publish my work here can be considered as a contribution to those who wants to self learn PWA from basic by cracking up my code.

And also, please help on improving and fixing any issues if you like to, this is the beauty of open-source community. ;)

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
